#MUSIC LIBRARY LAB

music library containing artists and albums

This program uses a database (music_library) that contains two tables (artists and albums). Each table has a corresponding class, and these are contained in the models directory, under filenames artist.rb and album.rb.

Testing is console-driven, using console.rb

Database name (will need to be created if you are pulling from GitHub): music_library

#FULL BRIEF
You have been asked to create an app that will allow a music collector to manage their collection of CDs/records.

In their console they would like to be able to:

*Create and Save Artists

*Create and Save Albums

*List All Artists/Albums

*List all the albums they have by an artist

*Show the artist any album belongs to

Every artist should have a name, and each album should have a name/title, genre and artist ID.

Further tasks

Additionally it would be nice to be able to:

*Edit Artists/Albums
*Delete Artists/Albums
*Find Artists/Albums by their ID
